Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

How to compile my own C++ code that uses Essentia?
--------------------------------------------------


Here is an example how to compile
[standard_mfcc.cpp](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/blob/2.0.1/src/examples/standard_mfcc.cpp) example on Linux linking with a system-wide installation of Essentia (done by ```./waf install```) and all its dependencies. Modify to your needs. 

```
g++ -pipe -Wall -O2 -fPIC -I/usr/local/include/essentia/ -I/usr/local/include/essentia/scheduler/ -I/usr/local/include/essentia/streaming/  -I/usr/local/include/essentia/utils -I/usr/include/taglib -I/usr/local/include/gaia2 -I/usr/include/qt4 -I/usr/include/qt4/QtCore -D__STDC_CONSTANT_MACROS standard_mfcc.cpp -o standard_mfcc -L/usr/local/lib -lessentia -lfftw3 -lyaml -lavcodec -lavformat -lavutil -lsamplerate -ltag -lfftw3f -lQtCore -lgaia2
```

Alternatively, if you want to create and build your own examples, the easiest way is to add them to ```src/examples```
folder, modify ```src/examples/wscript``` file accordingly and use ```./waf configure --with-examples; ./waf``` to build
them.

You can build your application using XCode (OSX) following [these
steps](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/issues/58#issuecomment-38530548).


OSX static builds and templates (JUCE/VST and openFrameworks)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here you can find portable 32-bit static builds of the Essentia C++ library and its dependencies for OSX (thanks to Cárthach from GiantSteps) as well as templates for JUCE/VST and
openFrameworks:

How to know which other Algorithms an Algorithm uses?
-----------------------------------------------------

The most obvious answer is: by reading its code. However, it is also possible to generate such a list automatically.
Running the python script ```src/examples/python/show_algo_dependencies.py``` will output a list of all intermediate
Algorithms created within each Algorithm in Essentia. It utilizes the logging framework and watches for messages
generated by AlgorithmFactory at the moment of running ```create()``` method for each internal algorithm.  Note, that
you cannot be sure this list of dependencies is 100% correct as the script simply instantiates each algorithm to test for its
dependencies, but does not run the ```compute``` stage. It is up to developers conscience to keep instantiations in a correct place, and if
an Algorithm is being created on the ```compute``` stage, it will be unnoticed.
