.. How-to install Essentia

Installing Essentia
===================

Mac OSX
-------
The easiest way to install Essentia on OSX is by using `our Homebrew formula <https://github.com/MTG/homebrew-essentia>`_. You will need to install `Homebrew package manager <http://brew.sh>`_ first (and there are other good reasons to do so apart from Essentia).


Note that packages location for Python installed via Homebrew is different from the system Python. If you plan to use Essentia with Python, make sure the Homebrew directory is at the top of your PATH environment variable. To this end, add the line::

  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

at the bottom of your ``~/.bash_profile`` file. More information about using Python and Homebrew is `here <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/Homebrew-and-Python.md>`_.


Linux
-----
We are currently preparing deb packages for Ubuntu and Debian. Meanwhile, you need to compile Essentia from source (see below).


Windows, Android, iOS
---------------------
Cross-compile Essentia from Linux/OSX (see below).


.. Installing Essentia is easily done using the precompiled packages that you can find on the
.. `MIR-dev Essentia download page <http://static.mtg.upf.edu/mir-dev-download/essentia/>`_.
.. Packages are available for Debian/Ubuntu, Windows and Mac OS X.

.. These packages contain development headers to integrate Essentia in a C++ application, Python
.. bindings to be able to work in a Matlab-like environment, and some C++ examples and extractors.

.. Those who wish to write new descriptors can do it using the provided development headers,
.. but it is highly recommended though that they compile Essentia from source.


Compiling Essentia from source
==============================

Essentia depends on (at least) the following libraries:
 - `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org>`_: for the FFT implementation *(optional)*
 - `libavcodec/libavformat/libavutil/libavresample <http://ffmpeg.org/>`_ (from the FFmpeg/LibAv project): for loading/saving any type of audio files *(optional)*
 - `libsamplerate <http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/>`_: for resampling audio *(optional)*
 - `TagLib <http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html>`_: for reading audio metadata tags *(optional)*
 - `LibYAML <http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML>`_: for YAML files input/output *(optional)*
 - `Gaia <https://github.com/MTG/gaia>`_: for using SVM classifier models *(optional)*
All dependencies are optional, and some functionality will be excluded when a dependency is not found.

Installing dependencies on Linux
--------------------------------

You can install those dependencies on a Debian/Ubuntu system from official repositories using the command below::

  sudo apt-get install build-essential libyaml-dev libfftw3-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libavresample-dev python-dev libsamplerate0-dev libtag1-dev

In order to use python bindings for the library, you might also need to install python-numpy-dev (or python-numpy on Ubuntu) and python-yaml for YAML support in python::

  sudo apt-get install python-numpy-dev python-numpy python-yaml


Note that, depending on the version of Essentia, different versions of libav* and libtag1-dev packages are required. See `release notes for official releases <https://github.com/MTG/essentia/releases>`_. 

Since the 2.1-beta3 release of Essentia, the required version of TagLib (libtag1-dev) is greater or equal to ``1.9``. The required version of LibAv (``libavcodec-dev``, ``libavformat-dev``, ``libavutil-dev`` and ``libavresample-dev``) is greater or equal to ``10``. The appropriate versions are distributed in Ubuntu 14.10 or later, and in Debian wheezy-backports. If you want to install Essentia on older versions of Ubuntu/Debian, you will have to `install a proper LibAv version from source <FAQ.html#build-essentia-on-ubuntu-14-04-or-earlier>`_.


Installing dependencies on Mac OS X
-----------------------------------

Install Command Line Tools for Xcode. Even if you install Xcode from the app store you must configure command-line compilation by running::

  xcode-select --install

Install `Homebrew package manager <http://brew.sh>`_.

Insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable by adding the following line at the bottom of your ``~/.profile`` file::

  export PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH

Install prerequisites::

  brew install pkg-config gcc readline sqlite gdbm freetype libpng

Install Essentia's dependencies::

  brew install libyaml fftw ffmpeg libsamplerate libtag

`Install python environment using Homebrew <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx>`_ (Note that you are advised to do as described here and there are `good reasons to do so <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/osx/>`_. You will most probably encounter installation errors when using python/numpy preinstalled with OSX.)::

  brew install python --framework
  pip install ipython numpy matplotlib pyyaml



Compiling Essentia
------------------

Once your dependencies are installed, you can proceed to compiling Essentia. Download Essentia's source code at `Github <https://github.com/MTG/essentia>`_.  Due to different dependencies requirement (see `release notes for official releases <https://github.com/MTG/essentia/releases>`_), make sure to download the version compatible with your system:
 - **2.1 beta3** is the version currently recommended to install. It is supported on **Ubuntu 14.10 or later**, **Debian Jessie or later** and **OSX**. Build LibAv from source for support on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or Debian Wheezy. 
 - **master** branch is the most updated version of Essentia in development
 

Go into its source code directory and start by configuring it::

  ./waf configure --mode=release --build-static --with-python --with-cpptests --with-examples --with-vamp

Use the keys:
 - ``--with-python`` to enable python bindings,
 - ``--with-examples`` to build `executable extractors <extractors_out_of_box.html>`_ based on the library,
 - ``--with-vamp`` to build Vamp plugin wrapper,
 - ``--with-gaia`` to build with Gaia library support.

NOTE: you must *always* configure at least once before building!

The following will give you a full list of options::

  ./waf --help

To compile everything you've configured::

  ./waf

All built examples will be located in ``build/src/examples/`` folder, as well as the Vamp plugin file ``libvamp_essentia.so``.

To install the C++ library, python bindings, extractors and Vamp plugin (if configured successfully; you might need to run this command with sudo)::

  ./waf install


Running tests (optional)
------------------------
If you want to assure that Essentia works correctly, do the tests.

To run the C++ base unit tests (only test basic library behavior)::

  ./waf run_tests

To run the python unit tests (include all unittests on algorithms, need python bindings installed first)::

  ./waf run_python_tests


Building documentation (optional)
---------------------------------

All documentation is provided on the official website of Essentia library. Follow the steps below to generate it by yourself.

Install doxigen and pip, if you are on Linux::

  sudo apt-get install doxygen python-pip

Install additional dependencies (you might need to run this command with sudo)::

  sudo pip install sphinx pyparsing sphinxcontrib-doxylink docutils jupyter
  sudo apt-get install pandoc

Make sure to install Essentia with python bindings and run::

  ./waf doc

Documentation will be located in ``doc/sphinxdoc/_build/html/`` folder.


Building Essentia on Windows
----------------------------

Essentia C++ library and extractors based on it can be compiled and run correctly on Windows, but python bindings are not supported yet. The easiest way to build Essentia is by `cross-compilation on Linux using MinGW <FAQ.html#cross-compiling-for-windows-on-linux>`_. However the resulting library binaries are only compatible within C++ projects using MinGW compilers, and therefore they are not compatible with Visual Studio. If you want to use Visual Studio, there is no project readily available, so you will have to setup one yourself and compile the dependencies too.

Building Essentia on Windows 10 via Bash on Ubuntu
--------------------------------------------------
It is possible to install Essentia easily via *bash on Ubuntu* on Windows 10. Bash on Ubuntu allows to run the same command-line utilities that could be run within a native Ubuntu 14.04 environment. Note that Bash on Ubuntu is still a beta product, hence there are some missing features and several issues. In addition, you cannot call Windows applications from bash.

To install bash on Ubuntu, follow the `official guide <https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/install_guide>`_ in the Microsoft Developer Network.

After bash on Ubuntu is successfully installed, you should open a bash terminal and install the dependencies (see: `Installing dependencies on Linux`_). Remember that bash on Windows runs on an Ubuntu 14.04 environment. Therefore, you may need to `install a proper LibAv version from source <FAQ.html#build-essentia-on-ubuntu-14-04-or-earlier>`_.

Finally, you can compile the Essentia (see: `Compiling Essentia from source`_).

Building Essentia on Android
----------------------------

A lightweight version of Essentia can be `cross-compiled for Android <FAQ.html#cross-compiling-for-android>`_ from Linux or Mac OSX.


Building Essentia on iOS
------------------------

A lightweight version of Essentia can be `cross-compiled for iOS <FAQ.html#cross-compiling-for-ios>`_ from Mac OSX.


Using pre-trained high-level models in Essentia
-----------------------------------------------

Essentia includes a number of `pre-trained classifier models for genres, moods and instrumentation
<algorithms_overview.html#other-high-level-descriptors>`_. In order to use them you need to:

* Install `Gaia2 library <https://github.com/MTG/gaia/blob/master/README.md>`_ (supported on Linux/OSX)
* Build Essentia with examples and Gaia (``--with-examples --with-gaia``)
* Use ``essentia_streaming_extractor_music`` (see `detailed documentation <streaming_extractor_music.html>`_)

You can `train your own classifier models <FAQ.html#training-and-running-classifier-models-in-gaia>`_.
