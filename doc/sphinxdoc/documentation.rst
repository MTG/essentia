``essentia`` is an open-source C++ library with Python and JavaScript bindings for **audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval**. 
It is released under the `Affero GPLv3 license <https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0>`_ and is also available under a proprietary license :doc:`upon request <licensing_information>`.
The following algorithms are included:

* **Audio file input/output**: ability to read and write nearly all audio file formats (wav, mp3, ogg, flac, etc.)
* **Standard signal processing blocks**: FFT, DCT, frame cutter, windowing, envelope, smoothing
* **Filters (FIR & IIR)**: low/high/band pass, band reject, DC removal, equal loudness
* **Statistical descriptors**: median, mean, variance, power means, raw and central moments, spread, kurtosis, skewness, flatness
* **Time-domain descriptors**: duration, loudness, LARM, Leq, Vickers' loudness, zero-crossing-rate, log attack time and other signal envelope descriptors
* **Spectral descriptors**: Bark/Mel/ERB bands, MFCC, GFCC, LPC, spectral peaks, complexity, roll-off, contrast, HFC, inharmonicity and dissonance
* **Tonal descriptors**: Pitch salience function, predominant melody and pitch, HPCP (chroma) related features, chords, key and scale, tuning frequency
* **Rhythm descriptors**: beat detection, BPM, onset detection, rhythm transform, beat loudness
* **Other high-level descriptors**: danceability, dynamic complexity, audio segmentation, SVM classifier, TensorFlow wrapper for inference
* **Machine learning models**: inference with SVM classifiers and TensorFlow models

You can install Essentia Python from PyPi:

.. code-block::

    pip install essentia

To use TensorFlow models, install via the command:

.. code-block::
   
    pip install essentia-tensorflow


For more details on how to use the library see the documentation section.
