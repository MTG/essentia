Algorithms overview
===================

This is a slightly detailed list describing the main algorithms you can find in Essentia
as well as a small description.

Please note that this is not an exhaustive list but rather a quick overview of the most used
algorithms in Essentia. For the full list of algorithms and their detailed documentation,
please see the :doc:`complete reference <algorithms_reference>`.


Audio input / output
--------------------

Essentia has a variety of audio loaders to provide a very convenient way to load audio files from disk:

* ``AudioLoader``: this is the most basic audio loader. It will load the given audio file and
  return the stream of stereo samples. If the audio file was mono, only the left channel is used.
  It will load virtually any format existing as it uses the `FFmpeg`_ libraries to load audio.
  It will also load the audio from a given video file (works even with Flash files!).
* ``MonoLoader``: probably the most used audio loader, the ``MonoLoader`` will downmix the file
  to a mono signal and resample it to the given sample rate (default 44.1 KHz).
* ``EasyLoader``: a ``MonoLoader`` which can also trim the audio to a given start/end time and
  normalize the resulting samples using a given `ReplayGain`_ value.
* ``EqloudLoader``: an ``EasyLoader`` that applies an `Equal-loudness`_ filter to the resulting
  audio
* ``MetadataReader``: reads the metadata tags stored in the given file (e.g.: mp3 tags, ...).

Essentia can also write audio files, using the following algorithms:

* ``AudioWriter``: a versatile audio writer that can write a stream of samples to any format
  supported by `FFmpeg`_. Takes as input a stream of stereo samples.
* ``MonoWriter``: an ``AudioWriter`` that takes a stream of mono samples as input.
* ``AudioOnsetsMarker``: writes an audio file given the stream of samples adding beeps at the given onset times.


Standard signal processing algorithms
-------------------------------------

The following algorithms are quite standard in any signal processing library:

* ``FrameCutter``: takes an input audio stream and cuts it into frames.
* ``Windowing``: returns a windowed frame (supports a lot of standard window types, such as Hann,
  Hamming, Blackman-Harris, ...).
* ``FFT``: the omnipresent (complex) `Fast Fourier Transform`_ algorithm.
* ``Spectrum``: returns only the magnitude part of the ``FFT`` algorithm.
* ``DCT``: the type II `Discrete Cosine Transform`_.
* ``Envelope``: an envelope follower.
* ``PeakDetection``: detects peaks in an array of values.
* ``Resample``: resamples a given audio signal.
* ``Slicer``: returns the given slices (start/end times) of an audio stream.
* ``ReplayGain``: returns the `ReplayGain`_ value for the given audio.
* ``CrossCorrelation``: computes the `cross-correlation`_ of two signals.
* ``AutoCorrelation``: computes the `auto-correlation`_ of a signal.
* ``CartesianToPolar`` and ``PolarToCartesian``: do the conversion of complex arrays between
  the polar and the cartesian coordinate systems.

Statistics
----------

The following algorithms compute statistics over an array of values, or do some kind
of aggregation:

* ``Mean``, ``GeometricMean``, ``PowerMean``, and ``Median``: do what their names hint at.
* ``Energy``: computes the energy of the array.
* ``RMS``: computes the Root mean square of the array.
* ``SingleGaussian``: computes a single Gaussian estimation for the given list of arrays (returns the
  mean array, its covariance and inverse covariance matrices)
* ``CentralMoments`` and ``RawMoments``: compute the moments up to the 5th-order of the array.
* ``Variance``, ``Skewness`` and ``Kurtosis``: are often used to describe probability distributions.
* ``DistributionShape``: combines the ``Variance``, ``Skewness`` and ``Kurtosis`` values in a single vector.
* ``Flatness``, ``Crest``, ``InstantPower`` are some others lesser used algorithms.

Filters
-------

Essentia implements a nice variety of audio filters:

* ``IIR``: a generic algorithm that does `IIR`_ filtering, where you can specify the coefficients manually.
* ``LowPass``, ``BandPass`` and ``HighPass``: do 1st or 2nd order low-, band- and high-pass filtering.
* ``BandPass``, ``BandReject``: do band-pass and band-rejection filtering.
* ``DCRemoval``: removes the DC component of a signal.
* ``EqualLoudness``: filters the signal using an equal-loudness curve approximating filter.

Classifier models
'''''''''''''''''

You can `train your own classifier models <FAQ.html#training-and-running-classifier-models-in-gaia>`_.

In addition, we provide a number of `pre-trained classifier models <http://acousticbrainz.org/datasets/accuracy>`_:

* musical genre (4 different databases)
* ballroom music classification
* moods: happy, sad, aggressive, relaxed, acoustic, electronic, party
* western / non-western music
* tonal / atonal
* danceability
* voice / instrumental
* gender (male, female singer)
* timbre (dark, bright)


These models were trained on a number of annotated music collections, including various inhouse collections created at Music Technology Group. To run them, use the standalone `Music Extractor <streaming_extractor_music.html#high-level-classifier-models>`_ available in Essentia 2.1_beta2.


Extractors
----------

As Essentia algorithms can themselves be composed of multiple algorithms
(see :doc:`Composite algorithms <composite_api>`),
a few useful extractors have been written as algorithms. They are the following:

* ``LevelExtractor``: computes the loudness of a music track.
* ``LowLevelSpectralExtractor``: computes a lot of low-level features from a music stream.
* ``LowLevelSpectralEqloudExtractor``: computes a lot of low-level features which require preliminary equal-loudness filter from a music stream.
* ``TuningFrequencyExtractor``: computes the tuning frequency of a music track.
* ``KeyExtractor``: computes the key and scale of a music track.
* ``TonalExtractor``: computes the tonal information of a music track (key, scale, chords sequence, chords histogram, ...)
* ``RhythmDescriptors``: computes the rhythm information of music track (beat positions, BPM and related histogram statistics).
* ``Extractor``: extracts pretty much all the features useful as descriptors for doing music similarity.
