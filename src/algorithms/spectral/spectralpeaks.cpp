It is important to note that the peak algorithm is independent of an input that is linear or in dB, so one has to adapt the threshold to fit with the type of data fed to it. The algorithm relies on PeakDetection algorithm which is run with parabolic interpolation [1]. The exactness of the peak-searching depends heavily on the windowing type. It gives best results with dB input, a blackman-harris 92dB window and interpolation set to true. According to [1], spectral peak frequencies tend to be about twice as accurate when dB magnitude is used rather than just linear magnitude. For further information about the peak detection, see the description of the PeakDetection algorithm.\n"
