"  - filterbank of 40 bands from 0 to 11000Hz\n"
"  - take the log value of the spectrum energy in each mel band\n"
"  - DCT of the 40 bands down to 13 mel coefficients\n"
"There is a paper describing various MFCC implementations [1].\n"
"\n"
"The parameters of this algorithm can be configured in order to behave like HTK [3] as follows:\n"
"  - type = 'magnitude' \n"
"  - warpingFormula = 'htkMel' \n"
"  - weighting = 'linear'\n"
"  - highFrequencyBound = 8000\n"
"  - numberBands = 26\n"
"  - numberCoefficients = 13\n"
"  - normalize = 'unit_max'\n"
"  - dctType = 3\n"
"  - logType = 'log'\n"
"  - liftering = 22\n"
"\n"
"In order to completely behave like HTK the audio signal has to be scaled by 2^15 before the processing and if the Windowing and FrameCutter algorithms are used they should also be configured as follows. \n"
"\n"
"FrameGenerator:\n"
"  - frameSize = 1102 \n"
"  - hopSize = 441 \n"
"  - startFromZero = True \n"
"  - validFrameThresholdRatio = 1 \n"
"\n"
"Windowing:\n"
"  - type = 'hamming' \n"
"  - size = 1102 \n"
"  - zeroPadding = 946 \n"
"  - normalized = False \n"
"\n"
"This algorithm depends on the algorithms MelBands and DCT and therefore inherits their parameter restrictions. An exception is thrown if any of these restrictions are not met. The input \"spectrum\" is passed to the MelBands algorithm and thus imposes MelBands' input requirements. Exceptions are inherited by MelBands as well as by DCT.\n"
"\n"
"IDCT can be used to compute smoothed Mel Bands. In order to do this: \n "
"- compute MFCC\n"
"- smoothedMelBands = 10^(IDCT(MFCC)/20) \n"
"Note: The second step assumes that 'logType' = 'dbamp' was used to compute MFCCs, otherwise that formula should be changed in order to be consistent.\n"
