The attack time is defined as the time duration from when the sound becomes perceptually audible to when it reaches its maximum intensity. By default, the start of the attack is estimated as the point where the signal envelope reaches 20% of its maximum value in order to account for possible noise presence. Also by default, the end of the attack is estimated as as the point where the signal envelope has reached 90% of its maximum value, in order to account for the possibility that the max value occurres after the logAttack, as in trumpet sounds.\n\n"
