"\n"
"The main operations are:\n"
"  - normalizing detection functions,\n"
"  - summing detection functions into a global detection function,\n"
"  - smoothing the global detection function,\n"
"  - thresholding the global detection function for silence,\n"
"  - finding the possible onsets using an adaptative threshold,\n"
"  - cleaning operations on the vector of possible onsets,\n"
"  - onsets time conversion.\n"
"\n"
"Note:\n"
"  - This algorithm has been optimized for a frameRate of 44100.0/512.0.\n"
"  - At least one Detection function must be supplied at input.\n"
"  - The number of weights must match the number of detection functions.\n"
"\n"
"As mentioned above, the \"frameRate\" parameter expects a value of 44100/512 (the default), but will work with other values, although the quality of the results is not guaranteed then. An exception is also thrown if the input \"detections\" matrix is empty. Finally, an exception is thrown if the size of the \"weights\" input does not equal the first dimension of the \"detections\" matrix.\n"
