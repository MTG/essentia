Sensory dissonance (to be distinguished from musical or theoretical dissonance) measures perceptual roughness of the sound and is based on the roughness of its spectral peaks. Given the spectral peaks, the algorithm estimates total dissonance by summing up the normalized dissonance values for each pair of peaks. These values are computed using dissonance curves, which define dissonace between two spectral peaks according to their frequency and amplitude relations. The dissonance curves are based on perceptual experiments conducted in [1]."
