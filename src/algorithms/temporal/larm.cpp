The LARM model is based on the asymmetrical low-pass filtering of the Peak Program Meter (PPM), combined with Revised Low-frequency B-weighting (RLB) and power mean calculations. LARM has shown to be a reliable and objective loudness estimate of music and speech.\n"
"\n"
"It accepts a power parameter to define the exponential for computing the power mean. Note that if the parameter's value is 2, this algorithm would be equivalent to RMS and if 1, this algorithm would be the mean of the absolute value.\n"
