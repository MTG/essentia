"Exceptions are thrown when the size the vectors specified in parameters is not equal and at least they contain two elements. Also if the parameter vector for x-coordinates is not sorted ascendantly. A break point function cannot interpolate outside the range specified in parameter \"xPoints\". In that case an exception is thrown.\n "
