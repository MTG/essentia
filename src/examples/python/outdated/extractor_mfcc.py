    # perform any operations other than those described below in the __init__ method. This is because

    # inputs and outputs, and connecting inner algorithms. You do not need to abide by this
    # restriction if you never intend to translate your composite algorithm to c++ code.

    # To make this point clearer: it might have been convenient to only accept a frameSize
    # parameter, and internally, set a hopSize variable to half the frameSize. So within our
    # __init__ method, we would have a statement like "hopSize = frameSize/2". However, because this
