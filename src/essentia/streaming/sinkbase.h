 * It is untyped (in the sense that it doesn't know which type are the tokens),
 * but derives from TypeProxy and as such has functions to can do type-checking
 * with respect to the types of the derived Sink (which is a templated class,
 * the template being the token type). Look at the Sink implementation for more
