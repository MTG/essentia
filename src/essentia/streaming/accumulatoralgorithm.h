/**
 * An AccumulatorAlgorithm is a special class of streaming algorithm that behaves
 * in the following way:
 *  - during most of the processing, it just consumes whatever comes in on its
 *    defined input (unique), and use that to maintain an internal state
 *  - when the end of the stream is reached, it computes a resulting value and
 *    outputs it on its defined source(s).
 *
 * By subclassing the AccumulatorAlgorithm class, you get all the buffering and
 * data management done for you. In exchange, you just need to implement 2 methods:
 *
 *  - void consume();
 *      which will be called during the processing. When called, you can safely
 *      assume that the data has already been acquired on your defined input sink
 *
 *  - void finalProduce();
 *      which will be called at the end of the stream, when all the tokens will
 *      have been fed to the consume() method. You will have to explicitly push your
 *      result
 *
 *
 * You will also need to declare your input sink and output source using the
 * specialized @c declareInputStream and @c declareOutputResult methods, instead of
 * the standard @c declareInput and @c declareOutput ones.
 *
 * As an example, please refer to the source code of the TCToTotal algorithm.
 *
 * WARNING: declaring multiple input streams will result in undefined behavior.
 *          Multiple output results are fine, though.
 *
 * WARNING: if you overload the reset() method, do not forget to call the base class
 *          implementation in it.
