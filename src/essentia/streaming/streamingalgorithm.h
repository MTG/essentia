 *
 *  - OK        means that all sources and sinks could acquire enough tokens.
 *              when you return this from the process() method it means you
 *              actually managed to consume and/or produce something.
 *
 *  - CONTINUE  synonym with OK, means we did do something and want to continue
 *              consuming/producing.
 *
 *  - PASS      means that you don't want to do anything at the moment, for
 *              instance if you are waiting for the end of the stream. This
 *              can only be returned by the process() method.
 *              (implementation detail: in effect, this means the same as
 *              NO_INPUT, which is that everything that could be consumed has
 *              been consumed, but it looks semantically better in certain
 *              places, hence its existence)
 *
 *  - FINISHED  means that you returned something, but that you don't want
 *              to be called anymore. This can only be returned by the
 *              process() method, and should be used by those algorithms
 *              that wait for the end of the stream to output a value.
 *
 *  - NO_INPUT  means that there was at least one Sink for which there were
 *              not enough tokens available.
 *
 *  - NO_OUTPUT means that there was at least one Source for which there were
 *              not enough tokens available (output buffer full).

/**
 * A streaming::Algorithm is an algorithm that can be used in streaming mode.
 * It is very similar to a 'classic' algorithm, but instead of having inputs
 * and outputs that you need to set manually each time you want to call the
 * process() method, they have input stream connectors (called Sinks, because
 * data flows into them as water in a sink) and output stream connectors (called
 * Sources, because data flows out of them).
 *
 * Connections between two algorithms (actually, between a source and a sink)
 * represent a flow of Tokens, which can be of any type, as long as the Source
 * and Sink are themselves of the same type. A token is the smallest unit you
 * can have in your stream. For example, for an audio stream, the token type
 * will be Real, because a single audio sample is represented as a Real. A
 * frame cutter which outputs frames will have the Token type set to
 * vector<Real>, because you can't take smaller than that, otherwise the frame
 * would be incomplete. A framecutter is then a strange beast, because it has
 * a Sink<Real> (input is a stream of audio samples), but has also a
 * Source<vector<Real> >, because it outputs whole frames one by one. This
 * might seem strange, but is not a problem at all.
 *
 * NB: of course, the input of the framecutter will consume tokens much more
 *     quickly than the rate at which it produces output tokens (frames). That
 *     is not a problem at all.
