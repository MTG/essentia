Essentia is an open-source C++ library for audio analysis and audio-based music information retrieval released under the Affero GPLv3 license. It contains an extensive collection of reusable algorithms which implement audio input/output functionality, standard digital signal processing blocks, statistical characterization of data, and a large set of spectral, temporal, tonal and high-level music descriptors. The library is also wrapped in Python and includes a number of predefined executable extractors for the available music descriptors, which facilitates its use for fast prototyping and allows setting up research experiments very rapidly. Furthermore, it includes a Vamp plugin to be used with Sonic Visualiser for visualization purposes. Essentia is designed with a focus on the robustness of the provided music descriptors and is optimized in terms of the computational cost of the algorithms. The provided functionality, specifically the music descriptors included in-the-box and signal processing algorithms, is easily expandable and allows for both research experiments and development of large-scale industrial applications.

Installation
------------

The library is cross-platform and currently supports Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS and Android systems. Read installation instructions:
-  http://essentia.upf.edu/documentation/installing.html 
-  [doc/sphinxdoc/installing.rst](doc/sphinxdoc/installing.rst)

Install from master for the latest updates.

To use in Python (Linux `x86_64`, `i686`): `pip install essentia` or `pip install essentia-tensorflow`.\
Note: Python `3.12` and newer are not supported.

Docker images: https://hub.docker.com/r/mtgupf/essentia/


You can download and use prebuilt static binaries for a number of Essentia's command-line music extractors instead of installing the complete library

Asking for help
---------------

[Read frequently asked questions](FAQ.md).

[Create an issue on github](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/issues) or [open a new discussion](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/discussions) if your question was not answered before.


Versions
--------

Official releases: https://github.com/MTG/essentia/releases

Github branches:
- [master](https://github.com/MTG/essentia/tree/master): latest updates; if you got any problem, try it first.

If you use example extractors (located in src/examples), or your own code employing Essentia algorithms to compute descriptors, you should be aware of possible incompatibilities when using different versions of Essentia.
